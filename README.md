# Templating with LaTex and Python

This year I'm trying to generate quizzes automatically to the degree possible.

I've cooked up a templating scheme using [jijna2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/)

This [article](http://eosrei.net/articles/2015/11/latex-templates-python-and-jinja2-generate-pdfs) was very helpful.
